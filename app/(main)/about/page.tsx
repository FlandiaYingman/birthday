          This webpage is made by me (Harry, or Flandia) for Janis's birthday.
          Also, it is a chance for me to try out new web technologies, so I
          really appreciate it.
        </p>

        <h2>Janis... </h2>
        <p>
          Thanks for being a great friend and for always being there for me. I
          really appreciate that I have such a great friend like you. As always,
          I'm here for you too. I hope that you enjoy the page and have a great
          day!
